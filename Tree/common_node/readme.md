Given two Binary Search Trees. Find the nodes that are common in both of them, ie- find the intersection of the two BSTs.

Note: Return the common nodes in sorted order.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N1 + N2) where N1 and N2 are the sizes of the 2 BSTs.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(H1 + H2) where H1 and H2 are the heights of the 2 BSTs.
